    "\n",
    "*Objectives*: Gain experience loading a CSV dataset into a database model you define yourself and using SQL to explore its contents. Explore the data by writing and executing a number of SQL queries using common syntax and functions and describing your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Grading criteria*: The tasks should all be completed, and questions should all be answered with SQL queries in the space provided, unless a text answer is requested. Results should be correct, according to the embedded tests. The notebook itself should be completely reproducible; from start to finish, another person should be able to use the same code to obtain the same results as yours.  Note that you will receive no more than partial credit if you do not add text/markdown cells explaining your thinking at each major step in each problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Deadline*: Friday, October 21, 12pm. Submit your notebook to Blackboard and push it to your GitHub repository.\n",
